# DIY SmashB0XX

This repo is forked from Crane's amazing DIYB0XX project, linked here: https://github.com/Crane1195/DIYB0XX/. It is an attempt to make an easily configurable method of flashing a B0XX-like (nearly identical) firmware to Hitbox Arcade's Smash Box. Check the readme in code/DIYB0XX for more information, including an easy tutorial for how to configure and flash this firmware on your own Smash Box. Credits to Crane for pretty much all of the code here.
