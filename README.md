# DIY SmashB0XX

This repo is forked from Crane's amazing DIYB0XX project, linked here: https://github.com/Crane1195/DIYB0XX/. It is an attempt to make an easily configurable method of flashing a B0XX-like (nearly identical) firmware to Hitbox Arcade's Smash Box. Check the readme in code/DIYB0XX for more information, including an easy tutorial for how to configure and flash this firmware on your own Smash Box. Credits to Crane for pretty much all of the code here.

## Why use B0XX firmware over Smash Box firmware?

The Smash Box Designer is an amazing tool, and I truly commend the Smash Box team for prioritizing user customization. But as of now (Beta 4.03 currently), the capabilities of the Smash Box Designer are quite limited. This is partly why the Smash Box has 6 modifier keys by default (Tilt, Tilt2, X1, X2, Y1, and Y2). The B0XX has some optimizations in its code (called "conditional modifiers") that reduce the number of modifier keys to only two without compromising any functionality. By default, the B0XX is capable of more Firefox angles than the Smash Box, despite having 4 less modifier keys. This is just the tip of the iceberg, but I'm not going to list all of the differences or advantages the B0XX firmware has over Smash Box here; you can do the research yourself (both controllers are quite well documented). Just know that in my experience using the Smash Box Designer, I ran into several limitations that made it impossible to replicate all of the B0XX's functionality with only two mod keys.
